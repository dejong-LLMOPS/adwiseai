# AdWiseAI â€“ Agile Project Plan

## Project Summary

**AdWiseAI** is an end-to-end LLMOps system designed to automate digital advertising analysis and optimization. It ingests campaign data, generates insights using large language models (LLMs), rewrites ad copy, captures feedback, and supports monitoring and retraining pipelines. The system is built using Databricks, Azure services, and modern MLOps best practices.

**Methodology**: Agile  
**Timeline**: 6 Weeks  
**Sprints**: 1-week sprints with clear deliverables  
**Final Deliverable**: Public GitHub repository with a working API, example data, and documentation
